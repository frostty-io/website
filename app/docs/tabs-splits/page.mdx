# Tabs & Splits

Frostty is built for multi-task terminal workflows.

## Tabs

- `Cmd + T`: open a new tab
- Drag and drop tabs to reorder
- `Cmd + 1` to `Cmd + 9`: jump to tab by index
- `Cmd + Shift + T`: restore a closed tab

## Split Panes

- `Cmd + D`: split current tab pane
- Run different commands side-by-side in one tab
- Resize panes by dragging the divider
- `Cmd + Up` / `Cmd + Down`: move focus between panes

## Recommended Workflow

1. Keep one tab per task (frontend, backend, tests, git).
2. Use splits inside a tab for related commands (server + logs, tests + watch mode).
3. Keep long-running commands in dedicated panes.
4. Use profiles so each new tab starts in the right shell and directory.
