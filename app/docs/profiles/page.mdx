# Profiles

Profiles let you define how new tabs start: shell, working directory, and appearance.

## Create a Profile

1. Open **Settings** with `Cmd + ,`.
2. Go to the **Profiles** section.
3. Create a new profile and configure:
   - Name
   - Shell (for example `zsh` or `bash`)
   - Default working directory
   - Tab color

## Use a Profile

- Open a new tab and choose the profile.
- Tabs opened with that profile inherit its shell and working directory.
- Use multiple profiles for different workflows (app repo, infra repo, personal scripts).

## Edit or Remove Profiles

- Update profile values in Settings at any time.
- Delete unused profiles to keep profile selection clean.
- Keep at least one general-purpose profile as your default.
